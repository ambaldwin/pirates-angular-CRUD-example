# pirates-angular-CRUD-example

A basic CRUD app example using the NEAP stack - Node, Express, Angular, PostgreSQL. Users can create, update, and delete the blog-post style Pirates. ARGH!

##Features
1. On the home page, the 'Add New Pirate' button makes a form appear where users can add in information to form a new blog-type post with the pirate's information.

2. Users can click into each individual pirate (the pirates' names are links) to go to the pirate's individual page. Here, users can click the edit button (the edit form pops up) to edit the post and also delete the post.
